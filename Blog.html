              <img src="Images\blogfeature.png">
              <p>Before I ever learned how to code, I worked in healthcare.I actually studied to become a Medical Coder, which is its own coding language in its own right. That was the first exposure i had to anything remotely resembling code. I worked in the healthcare industry for a few years and them boom. Covid hit. At first I was sent to work from home. Then things got dicey. After 3 months of no change, 10% of company was laid off. In a flash, my healthcare career was over just as soon as it began.</p>  
              <p>This lead me down a new path. I had to figure out what i wanted to do next. I had plenty of time on my hands so that wasn't the issue. I knew I needed something that challenged me and kept me moving forward. Tech has always been that. Innovations are happening at the speed of light and we have yet to truly catch up. Once we're into something, something new pops up. It was exciting! It also fed my ADHD. New meant novelty. Novelty meant interest.</p>
              <p>But how does this tell you how to learn to code? Great question. To learn how I learned, we first had to learn where I started. Safe to say I was a complete beginner with coding. It's a perfect place to start. Mold your mind from scratch. The best way to learn is, of course, with instruction and mentorship. The caveat with this is we have to pay thousands of dollars for this instruction and mentorship and there are no guarantees you'll be able to use the knowledge you've gained. Another way, the way I learned, is to find free resources online to help you get started. One such resource that I love to recommend is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>.</p>
              <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"><img class="fcc" src="Images\fcc.png"></a>
              <p>Free Code Camp is a free online resource that offers several coding courses. These courses come with certifications and project you can add to your portfolio, all without costing a dime. The site does ask for a monthly $5 donation but it is optional and never required to use the material. Free Code Camp also provides a community of mentors, instructors, and fellow newbie coders from around the world. They boast that many web developers have been able to land roles with just their free courses. With bite-sized lessons and hands-on practice, it's safe to say they're onto something. </p>
              <p>"But Maiya, I need actual instruction, structure, and community!" No worries! There's another you can learn to code for free that offers structure, instruction, and community. If you are a Black American looking to learn to code and needing some guidance, Udacity is the platform for you. Certain companies will sponsor one or more programs to help those in need of upskilling. One such company is the <a href="https://oneten.org/">OneTen Organization</a> in conjunction with the <a href="https://foundation.blacksintechnology.net/">Blacks In Tech Foundation</a>. While this opportunity is unique to Black Americans, there are other companies that may do the same for other marginalized groups. (Of course, Free Code Camp is a great option all on its own). </p>
              <p>The program I am currently in and will ultimately graduate from is the OneTen Scholarship Program with Udacity. I chose the Front end Web Development Nanodegree. There are several nanodegrees offered through Udacity, but this one is the one I used to take coding seriously. With the structure and the community, I was sure to hold strong to my goals. Which, is true. I created this site from scratch. I learned to code and then applied that knowledge for this blog. (It also happens to be a project I had to complete for the program. Two for one deal!) The community is supportive and active so there's never a shortage of encouragement and help.</p>
              <p>Using Udacity and Free Code Camp to learn made coding easy for me. I always had support and I could supplement what I learned. Since both resources are free, it cost me 0 dollars to learn to code. You can do the same too! Set a goal to complete the work, practice, and create projects. Whether you're learning to code to change careers, get a promotion, or just for fun, I think we can all agree learning for free is the way to go.</p>
